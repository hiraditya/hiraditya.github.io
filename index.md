# Professional Experience

## Sr. Compiler engineer at Facebook (Since Aug. 2017)
* Compiler optimizations (llvm) geared towards improving runtime performance of native code
* Static Analysis (clang)
* Large scale source code refactoring and modernization
* Performance analysis and optimizations

## Sr. Compiler engineer at Samsung Austin R&D Center.

* Working on performance and code-size optimizations on gcc
  - Loop optimizations, polyhedral framework (graphite), vectorization, feedback directed optimizations, android performance improvements, refactoring gcc backend.
* Working on clang static analyzer in my spare time.
  - Writing checkers, running clang static analyzer on linux kernel, gcc.


## Sr. Compiler engineer at Qualcomm.

* Worked on LLVM compiler infrastructure specifically, on the Hexagon Backend.
  - Develop optimization algorithms to improve performance and code-size for Hexagon DSP. Global scheduling, Loops transformations, peephole optimizations, liveness analysis.
* Worked on clang static analyzer to improve checks to help find out potential bugs in C/C++ programs.

## Academic Projects (Texas A&M)

* A C++ library to facilitate random access of data in a file in an efficient way using memory-mapped file I/O facilities in Linux.
* Designed and implemented a lexical analyzer, parser, semantic analyzer, code generator and optimizer (control flow, dataflow, and register allocation) for 'DECAF', a subset of C++ programming language (flex, bison++ and C++).
* Designed and implemented an interpreter for Tiny SQL- a subset of SQL (C++).
* Implemented a branch mis-prediction recovery mechanism for a speculative branch predictor from the paper titled 'A Branch Predictor with New Recovery Mechanism' by Young-Il Cho, Department of Computer Science at University of Suwon.
* An intelligent active vision system using neuro-evolutionary techniques (Java).
* Implemented portions of operating system (virtual memory management, memory manager, low level threading system, file system) using the bochs emulation environment.
