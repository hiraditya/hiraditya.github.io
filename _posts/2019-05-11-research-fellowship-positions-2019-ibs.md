## About the call
The IBS Center for Geometry and Physics (IBS-CGP) invites applications for postdoctoral or senior research fellowship positions. 
Successful candidates for research fellowship positions must have exceptional research qualifications. 
These non-tenure- track appointments are for two or three years. 
The appointment is one time renewable up to 5 years in total contingent upon the outstanding performance of the researcher.
The center is located on the campus of [Pohang University of Science and Technology (POSTECH)](http://www.postech.ac.kr/eng/) 
in Pohang, South Korea and is part of the Institute for Basic Science, a government-funded research institute.

IBS-CGP is working to bring the worldâ€™s leading scientists in mathematics together with young researchers to collaborate 
on research projects with passion and commitment. To this end, IBS recruits based on scientific excellence and creative ideas,
rather than pre-determined goals or demonstrated practical outcomes. 
IBS provides an open and autonomous research environment. The existing members of IBS-CGP are working in symplectic geometry, 
geometric topology, dynamical systems, algebraic geometry, number theory and mathematical aspects of quantum field and string 
theory.
