# Abstract

Softwares have become an integral part of everyday life.  Every day, millions of people perform
transaction through various applications run by these softwares as internet, ATM, mobile phone, email
etc.  Softwares are used by people bearing in mind that it is reliable and can be trusted upon and the
operations they perform is secure.  Software security is the idea of software engineering to protect the
software from the unauthorized access and also protect from the malicious attack. As the use of tech-
nology increases significantly daily, there is wide use of software which increases the security threat
of software.  The consequences of the security breach are very acute on both personal and corporate
level.  Such consequences may result in financial loss, loss of reputation, compromisation of privacy
and many more severe cases. A tactical and strategic weapon could be used to countercheck the attacks
by providing physiological treatment in the form of Awareness on various inter-functional and intra-
functional aspects. In this paper we established the importance of software security awareness among
all the entities involved during and after the building phase.  We also presented common methods of
software security awareness delivery then we finally concluded the paper and provide future directions
to take towards software security awareness.
