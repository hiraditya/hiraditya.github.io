RISC-V International is committed to a diverse and inclusive community. The following questions (which are optional) are asked in an effort to track our progress in increasing diversity at events and will remain confidential.

What gender does the primary speaker identify with?*
Man
Does the primary speaker identify as a person of color?
No

If the primary speaker identifies with any other underrepresented group (disability, LGBTQIA+, etc.), please indicate below.
(No response)
Additional Speaker and/or Panelists

Note: Each session is allowed (1) primary speaker and (1) co­-speaker. All submissions with more than 2 speakers are considered panels and should be submitted as a panel discussion. 

RISC-V International does not accept panel submissions with all-men panelists of 3 or more in an effort to increase speaker diversity. 

Additionally, panel submissions must include the names of all participants in the initial submission to be considered.
Is this a panel discussion?*
No
Is there a co-speaker?*
No
Speaker Headshot
Please attach a headshot for each proposed presenter. If accepted, these photos will appear on the event website, agenda, and within the mobile app.

App Startup compiler optimizations and techniques for embedded systems
Abstract*
This is the description that will be posted on the website schedule if your talk is selected, Be sure to provide enough information to help attendees make the right choice. A well-written abstract will greatly increase the possibility of the proposal being accepted. (Maximum characters: 1,200)
Launch time of embedded applications has been a concern for a very long time. It has become more important with mobile apps as startup time often regresses with feature additions.

For many mobile applications, launch time test users patience. While smartphones are becoming faster, developers find creative ways to regress startup time by adding features or unnecessary software engineering.

Optimizing for launch time is a little different than optimizing purely for code size or for performance. Some code size optimizations help startup and so does many redundancy elimination optimizations. In this presentation I'll discuss program instrumentation techniques to get insights into application launch time. I'll share measurement techniques to get insights into different parts of application startup. I'll talk about compiler optimizations that help application launch time. I'll also present other methodologies to improve startup time like order file generation, removing static initializers etc.
Improve Your Chances of Being Selected
The information you share below will help the Technical Program Committee understand the full value of your proposed session. Asterisked questions are required, but we encourage you to share all these details with us.
Each technical presentation must tell the Summit audience how something works or analysis of existing systems. What is the “something” or “analysis” that you’ll be talking about? *
Describes the details of a program launch sequence, measurement techniques of different parts of program startup, and techniques to optimize application startup.
Your Summit audience should come away with new knowledge that most do not already have. Please list the three to five (3-5) things that your audience will learn from your presentation.*
1. Program launch sequence
2. Measurement of different parts of program launch sequence
3. Optimization techniques (both compiler optimizations, and software engineering techniques)
What, if any, novel thing(s) are described in the presentation? Please include a comparison with closely related work.
Everything described in this presentation can be found online or derived from the knowledge available publicly even though they are spread all over the place. This presentation uses existing knowledge to optimize program startup which has been getting increasingly important in recent years.
Is this open source or proprietary technology? Both are welcome but please specify which your presentation includes.
Open source.
What is the status of the technology? Is the technology you discuss in your presentation available today? And if not, when will it be available?
Available today.
Most of your presentation should discuss topics related to RISC-V. It’s okay to explain how an architecture-independent technology was mapped to RISC-V, but please describe what non-obvious RISC-V aspects of the mapping your presentation discusses.*
These techniques are applicable for applications running on embedded devices. These are also applicable to non-RISCV systems.
We value technical talks that arrive at a key conclusion – this could be results, a cost-benefit analysis, or even questions left to be decided in the future. What is the key conclusion of your talk?
Program startup latency is a key metric that affects most embedded applications.
