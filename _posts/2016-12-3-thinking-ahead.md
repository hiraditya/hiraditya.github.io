# Writing notes
Write your thoughts, your plans somewhere. Several people have phones with
them. Instead of whatsapping, facebooking spend some time writing about
yourself.  Write your goals, what do you want to do. Do you really want to lose
your valuable time writing about something which does not matter at all? Is your
time that useless? Are 'you' so useless!

If you are thinking what should you write, here are a few which could get you started.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Write what do you want to do
\item Write what you wish should be done
\item Write what you want others to do it for you
\item Write about why your life is great or mediocre or miserable
\item Write what you want to become tomorrow, next month, next year, in life
\item Write what would make this world a better place
\item Write about memories which you never want to forget
\end{enumerate}

# Revisiting your plans
If you made plans in the past, hopefully you wrote about it or maybe just kept
them in the back of your mind, then try to revisit them. Check what you planned,
what worked, what didn't. Did your plan worked? Perfect! This is time to make
new plans.  This is time to improve, make bigger plans.  If your plan did not
work, then think why didn't things happened as you wished. Were you not careful
enough. Were you not motivated enough. Maybe there were external factors, maybe
there were bigger priorities, maybe you found a better plan and succeded in
that. Or, maybe, you just didn't worked hard enough and let your life pass
by. Does it make sense to have a purpose in life?

Learn from your past achievements/mistakes.

# Observing
People who are successful are keen observers. You don't have to start looking
around for everything.  You just have to observe about things which you like
most. Chances are that you are a good observer about the things that appeal to
you. When you explore things that you like most, you start seeing patterns. You
start seeing the things that could be improved in them.

# Working backwards
After you have a plan, or a vague idea of what things could be improved. First
you need to imagine a layout/picture of what it should look like. Start writing
the features that it should have. As you start writing you would start getting a
better picture of it. Start taking notes on each aspect of your goal. Once you
have a rough draft of what you would like to be done, now comes the most
important part. The most important part is to break apart your draft into
smaller components. You need to identify components, you need to decompose the
whole into parts. You need to decompose until you have something to work
with. You don't have to completely understand all of it because you only have to
start with a few. As a result of decomposition you might have to revisit your
original idea. This back and forth refinement of your idea will give you a
better appetite, and increase your interest in working towards your goal.
