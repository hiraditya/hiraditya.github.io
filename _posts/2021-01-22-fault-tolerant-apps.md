## Motivation

"Our bodies have great availability. I have soft errors all the time: my memory fails once in a while, but I don't 'crash.' My whole body doesn't shut down when I cut a finger."
         --Robert Morris, director of IBM's Almaden Research Laboratory, on the inspiration of IBM's autonomic computing project
